I'm not putting much effort in this year to be clean and tidy. Just going to enjoy and do it :)

Note that for funsies I used AI to see what would happen. For example, I just pasted the problem into Gemini for some. Here are the results as I go along:

* Day 1: Gemini solved both parts first time
* Day 2: Gemini solved both parts first time
* Day 3: Gemini solved both parts first time
* Day 4:
  * Gemini failed on part one due to stack overflow (from recursion). I asked for a fix but then it gave the wrong number.
  * I started writing code myself and GitHub Copilot pretty much auto-completed everything once I gave it the right start.
  * Part 2 I just did myself. I didn't ask AI.
